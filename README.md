# landing_page

A screenshot of a required design was provided and was meant to be
duplicated. This was done by splitting the content into 6 main sections. The header and footer were standalone while the hero, info, quote, and call to action sections were encompassed into a main body that was allowed to flex-grow to fill up the whole page and push the header and footer to the top and bottom respectively. Each section had multiple divs within it to be able to flex them either horizontally or vertically. Specific styling attributes such as background colors and fonts were followed based off the specifications. To note, the "Roboto" font was not available nor was font-weight "light." 

The padding and margins were added manually in the effort to best replicate the design.
